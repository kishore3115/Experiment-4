House Price Prediction Dataset
1. Introduction:
Real estate prices are influenced by multiple factors, such as the size of the house, the number of bedrooms, the number of bathrooms, location, and other amenities. This dataset aims to capture key structural features of a house to build a Linear Regression Model that predicts house prices based on these attributes.
The dataset can be used for predictive modeling, real estate market analysis, and price estimation to help homeowners, investors, and real estate agents make informed decisions.
2. Dataset Description:
The dataset contains information about houses, including square footage, number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, and their respective prices. Below is a detailed description of the dataset features.
Features (Independent Variables)
1. Square Footage (sqft) – Represents the total living area of the house in square feet. Generally, larger houses are more expensive.
2. Number of Bedrooms (bedrooms) – Indicates how many bedrooms are in the house. More bedrooms usually mean a higher price, but not always.
3. Number of Bathrooms (bathrooms) – Represents the total number of bathrooms in the house. Homes with more bathrooms are generally priced higher.
Target Variable (Dependent Variable)
4. House Price (price) – The actual selling price of the house in dollars ($). This is the value we want to predict based on the other features.
Steps for House Price Prediction:
1. Get Data – Collect house details like size, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and price.
2. Prepare Data – Organize the data into a table for easy analysis.
3. Train the Model – Teach the model how house features affect price using past data.
4. Make Predictions – Give the model new house details, and it will estimate the price.
5. Check Accuracy – Compare predicted prices with actual prices to see how well the model works.
6. Use the Model – Predict prices for new houses based on their features.
The goal is to build a linear regression model that predicts house prices based on square footage, 
number of bedrooms, and bathrooms. This helps buyers, sellers, 
and real estate agents estimate fair market prices accurately.
